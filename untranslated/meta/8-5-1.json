The coverage of the source may vary in terms of the geographical areas covered, the workers covered (for example, part-time workers or informal workers may be excluded) and the establishments covered (for example, establishments below a certain size or of a certain sector may be excluded). In cases where the earnings of workers excluded from the coverage of the source are significantly different than those of workers included, the statistics would not be representative of the country as a whole and would not be strictly comparable to those of countries using a more comprehensive source. </p>\n<p>When using household surveys as a source of earnings statistics, there are a number of issues related to the accuracy of the earnings information reported by the respondents.
