According to the International Standard Classification of Education (ISCED), education is defined as organized and sustained communication designed to bring about learning. Formal education is defined in ISCED as education that is institutionalized, intentional, and planned through public organizations and recognized private bodies and, in their totality, make up the formal education system of a country.</p><p>Non-formal education, like formal education is defined in ISCED as education that is institutionalized, intentional and planned by an education provider but is considered an addition, alternative and/or a complement to formal education.

Informal learning is defined in ISCED as forms of learning that are intentional or deliberate, but not institutionalized. It is thus less organized and less structured than either formal or non-formal education. Informal learning may include learning activities that occur in the family, in the work place, in the local community, and in daily life, on a self-directed, family-directed or socially-directed basis. For the purposes of this indicator, persons will be considered in education if they are in formal or non-formal education, as described above, but excluding informal learning. </p><p>Employment is defined as all persons of working age who, during a short reference period (one week), were engaged in any activity to produce goods or provide services for pay or profit.  </p><p>For the purpose of this indicator, persons are considered to be in training if they are in a non-academic learning activity through which they acquire specific skills intended for vocational or technical jobs. </p><p>Vocational training prepares trainees for jobs that are based on manual or practical activities, and for skilled operative jobs, both blue and white collar related to a specific trade, occupation or vocation. Technical training on the other hand imparts learning that can be applied in intermediate-level jobs, in particular those of technicians and middle managers. </p>","UNIT_MEASURE":"<p>Percentage</p>","CLASS_SYSTEM":"<p>International Standard Classification of Occupations</p>","SOURCE_TYPE":"<p>Following the 19th International Conference of Labour Statisticians (19th ICLS) in 2013, the standards which had been introduced after the 13th ICLS in 1983 were revised. The rationale for revising these standards is documented in Report II of the 19th ICLS1. The rationale included evolving policy needs, changes in the labour market and patterns of work, and the limitations of the 1983 standards. The NLFS I and NLFS II followed standards that were in existence at that time, while the NLFS III followed the new, revised standards. This implies that most indicators generated from NLFS III may not be comparable to the previous rounds of NLFS. For example, although the new standard provides the opportunity to measure all forms of work, the employment definition in the new standard is narrower than was previously the case. While the previous definition of employment covered almost all activities within the System of National Accounts (SNA) production boundary, i.e. production for pay, profit or family gain, production for own final use, etc., the new definition of employment includes only work performed for others for pay or profit. Production for own final use is no longer regarded as employment. However, production for own final use accounted for a relatively large proportion of employment in Nepal previously. The higher unemployment and lower employment estimates reported in this report are in part the result of these changes.</p>","COLL_METHOD":"<p>The goal of sampling design was to achieve high level of efficiency of employment/unemployment estimates at the domain level (14 domains) considered as the primary strata with representative of 18,000 households. </p><p>In deciding on the sampling design, the characteristics of the frame was evaluated, foremost, normality of the distribution of auxiliary information (number of households) that was to be used in stratification and in sample selection. Kolmogorov-Smirnov test provided enough evidence against the assumption of normality of the distribution of number of households in each of the PSUs (p&lt;0.01) among the domains. In fact, there was adequate evidence that the distribution was skewed. There were too few PSUs with large number of households, and most of the PSUs had small number of households. Thus, stratification was necessary in this population. However, simple proportional allocation could easily lead to oversampling of the stratum with more elements and under sampling in the stratum with less elements. </p><p>The problem of skewed population was addressed through stratification of the PSUs in each domain into three following the Lavallee-Hidiroglou (LH) algorithm. This stratification method jointly minimizes the total coefficient of variation and the sample size in the choice of stratum boundaries and in the determination of sampling rate per stratum. Further accounting for the possible discrepancy between the stratification variables (number of households) and the target variables (e.g., number of employed individuals), modified LH Algorithm is used. Modified LH Algorithm used to identify stratum boundaries of the three strata. Stratum 1 and Stratum 2 are smaller than Stratum 3, and are called the \u201ctake some\u201d strata. Stratum 3, comprising of \u201cbigger\u201d PSUs where big is defined in terms of number of households, is also called \u201ctake all\u201d stratum. From all the strata, samples were drawn from probability proportional to size (PPS) except in the areas where all the PSUs were taken in the sample. Regarding the sampling from stratum 3, the \"take all\" criterion was followed in all the rural areas and urban areas of province 3 only.</p><p>The NLFS II questionnaire was developed on the basis of an ILO recommendation including core and supplementary modules comprising 130 questions in eight sections. This provided guidelines for developing the NLFS III questionnaire. The NLFS III questionnaire was substantially expanded to 168 questions in fourteen sections. The flow of questionnaire structure was organized in such a way that respondents' burden in the survey can be minimized. </p><p>For the sake of maintaining comparability and further use of disaggregated statistics, many questions from housing section were aligned with population and housing census. However, the change in the definition of employment implies that some indicators from this survey will not be comparable with the indicators from the previous rounds. In addition, some changes were made to address contemporary issues such as short-term returnees, volunteer work and forced labour situation in the country. The questionnaire was designed to capture data on general household information, current activities, current working hour, usual working hour, unemployment, past employment, and absentees. The sections on household information and absentee information were asked only to the head of household. </p><p>Branch of economic activities (industry) and occupation were open ended and they were later coded at the 4th digit level. Some of the questions were intended to provide statistics for monitoring the selected Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The flow chat describing the different paths of the questionnaire is attached as Annex IV. </p><p>Similar to NLFS I and NLFSII, work activities of children aged 5 and above were also collected in NLFS III. This included all forms of work i.e. work for pay, work for own final use and volunteer work. </p><p>Draft questionnaire was prepared with technical input from the ILO consultant and the household survey team of the CBS. The questionnaire was further modified after consultations with technical committee representing various interest groups. The questionnaire thereafter was pre-tested several times and revised intensively in accordance to the feedback received from each pre-test. The pre-tests were carried out to cover a wide range of areas and included different ecological belts and urban/rural areas. The questionnaire was finalized and endorsed by a Steering Committee chaired by the Vice-Chairman of National Planning Commission (NPC). The questionnaire in the final Nepali version was translated into English to ensure the same understandings for foreign users. Interviewer\u2019s manual in Nepali language was developed which included concepts, definitions, description of each question and fieldwork procedures, etc. to ensure that quality information was collected.</p>","FREQ_COLL":"<p>2026</p>","REL_CAL_POLICY":"<p>2026</p>","DATA_SOURCE":"<p>Central Bureau of Statistics</p>","COMPILING_ORG":"<p>Central Bureau of Statistics</p>","INST_MANDATE":"<p>National official statistical agency that is responsible for conducting, survey and census.</p>","RATIONALE":"<p>The share of youth not in employment, education or training (youth NEET rate) provides a measure of youth who are outside the educational system, not in training and not in employment, and thus serves as a broader measure of potential youth labour market entrants than youth unemployment.
