Handwashing facilities can consist of a sink with tap water, but can also include other devices that contain, transport or regulate the flow of water. Buckets with taps, tippy-taps and portable basins are all examples of handwashing facilities. Bar soap, liquid soap, powder detergent and soapy water all count as soap for monitoring purposes.</p>","UNIT_MEASURE":"<p>Percentage</p>","CLASS_SYSTEM":"<p>Global MICS guidelines by UNICEF</p>","SOURCE_TYPE":"<p>An international multi-purpose household survey programme was developed by UNICEF in the 1990s to support countries in collecting internationally comparable data on a wide range of indicators on the situation of children and women, widely known as global MICS programme. It measures key indicators that allows countries to generate data for using in policy making and designing programs, and to monitor progress towards the national goals and global commitments.</p>","COLL_METHOD":"<p>The sample for the Nepal MICS 2019 was designed to provide estimates for a large number of indicators on the situation of children and women at the national level, for urban and rural areas and seven provinces. The urban and rural areas within each province were identified as the main sampling strata. Kathmandu valley urban is included as a separate stratum as it\u2019s characteristics differ from the rest. Each stratum was a separate domain. The sample of household was selected in two stages. Within each stratum, at the first sampling stage a specified number of census enumerations areas (EA), was selected systematically with probability proportional to size. A household listing was carried out within the selected enumeration areas, identifying the households with and without children under 5 years. In total, 25 households with and without children under 5 were selected in each sample enumeration area through systematic random sampling method. To ensure strong representativeness of children under 5 in the sample, household with children under 5 were oversampled. Where 13 households with children under 5 and 12 households without were selected from listing in each enumeration area. A total sample of 512 enumeration area and 12800 households was selected for the survey. As the sample is not self-weighting, sample weights are used for reporting survey results. </p><p>The sampling frame of Nepal is based on the 2011 National population and Housing Census (NPHC). The census frame is a complete list of all census wards created for the 2011 NPHC. At the time of last census, the urban household population constituted 20% of the total household population. According to the latest changes in the administrative structure, following the federalization of the government, the urban household population increased to 65%. CBS updated the population frame to reflect the current status. In designing the sample for the Nepal MICS, it was very useful to review the sample design and results of the MICS conducted in 2014, documented in the Final Report of that survey. </p><p>Therefore, a multi-stage, stratified cluster sampling approach was used for the selection of the survey sample. The primary sampling units (PSUs) selected at the first stage were the enumeration areas (EAs) defined for the census enumeration. A listing of households was conducted in each sample enumeration area, and a sample of households was selected at the second stage.  </p><p>The questionnaires were developed based on the MICS 6 standard questionnaires of UNICEF. It was customized and translated into Nepali, Bhojpuri and Maithili language. After the development of questionnaire, it was pre-tested in Sindhupalchowk and Sindhuli district during March 2019. Based on the results of the pre-test, modifications were made to the wording and translation of the questionnaires.</p>","FREQ_COLL":"<p>2024</p>","REL_CAL_POLICY":"<p>2024</p>","DATA_SOURCE":"<p>Central Bureau of Statistics</p>","COMPILING_ORG":"<p>Central Bureau of Statistics</p>","INST_MANDATE":"<p>National official statistical agency that is responsible for conducting, survey and census.</p>","RATIONALE":"<p>Hygiene has long-established links with public health, and the explicit reference to hygiene in the text of SDG target 6.2 represents increasing recognition of the importance of hygiene and its close links with sanitation.
